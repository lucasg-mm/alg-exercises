Given a value V, we want to make the change to V. An infinite set of coins M = {M1, M2, .., Mm} each of a value is given.
What is the minimum number of coins that make up the V value?


Input

The input consists of a number of N test cases.
Subsequent lines are made up of integer values, in the following order:
The value V (0 <= V <= 100000); the quantity of coins Q (1 <= Q <= 30) and Q integer values m (1 <= m <= 100)

The problem may not be solved. In this case print 'no solution'
